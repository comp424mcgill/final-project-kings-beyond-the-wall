### Report Grade (41.0/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

The report is well written and the approach is well explained. However, it is not very well motivated. Section 1.3 is more of a comparison with minimax, rather than motivation to use MCTS for this specific game. It may help to link characteristics of the game to strengths of the algorithm. The pros/cons should discuss more about scenarios where the agent is better/worse. There are minor spelling errors.
